                <h3 class="subheader">What Specifically Is Deep Rock Galactic?</h3>
                <p class="body">Deep Rock Galactic is a four player co-op horde shooter game on par with games like <i>Left 4 Dead</i> and <i>Warhammer 40k: Darktide</i>. However, Deep Rock Galactic has multiple key differences to separate itself from the rest. To start, the environment of DRG is entirely destructable, as you're mining in the caves of a dangerous yet incredibly profitable planet known as Hoxxes IV. For another, the enemies that you're fighting are not zombified humans or godforsaken abominations, they're a variety of aliens that are native to Hoxxes, and are not exactly happy with DRG's antics. More than a dozen varients exist for the glyphids alone, the species that you'll be fighting the most in your time on Hoxxes. Four different classes of dwarf exist for you to run around as, and your teammates will be your best friends while your down in the mines. How well you can work together will be the key factor on whether you'll dig for riches, or dig your own graves.</p>

                <h2 class="header">DRG Based Roguelite Spinoff Announced!!</h2>
                <p class="body">A brand new Deep Rock Galactic spinoff has been announced by Ghost Ship Games! This new title, "Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core," is an upcoming roguelite spinoff of the Deep Rock Galactic franchise, planned to release by the end of 2024. Not much has been shown for the game other than the story and concept art, but the premise is simple. DRG sent out expeditions into the deeper core of Hoxxes with hopes of acquiring more of an invaluable mineral known as "expenite." Suddenly, all mining operations go dark, and entry into the dig site is not possible, indicating that the core of Hoxxes is fighting back. Our mission now is to venture back in and take back the core.</p>
