                <h1 class="title">Game Basics</h1>
                <p class="body">Deep Rock Galactic can be a complicated game when you're first starting out. Lots of keybinds when compared to other games, there can be a lot going on at once, and going with overpowered randoms can be a lot to comprehend and deal with at once. Stack that on top of all of the things that you cannot do and will not understand for a while, and you can feel very overwhelemed with everything that's going on. Luckily for you, this page will help you understand what everything does in a more understandable way.</p>
                <h2 class="header">When You Open the Game</h2>
                <p class="body">Everytime you open the game, you'll start out in one of the cabins of Space Rig 17. From here, you can do anything you have access to, including, but absolutely not limited to, starting a mission, checking your assignments, upgrading your perks on the monitor in the cabins, changing your weapon or cosemtic loadout, buying new cosmetics, or getting completely wasted at the Abyss Bar. To start a mission, go to the mission terminal outside the cabins, choose a mission from the ones that are available, choose what difficulty you'd like to play it in, and head into the drop pod when you're ready. If you choose to go solo, you'll be accompanied by the All Purpose Drone "Bosco." Bosco can help you out by providing covering fire, digging minerals, and various other things, but you'll need to use your laser pointer to tell him what to do outside of shooting enemies. It's also important to remember that everytime you start a mission, the layout and the contents of the cave will be randomly generated, meaning that no cave will be like another. Some enemies may or may not show up, various other events may happen to you that haven't happened to someone else in a week, and your optional secondary objective may be different. Things like the biome, length, and complexity may overlap, but no mission will exactly be the same as someone else's.</p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="header">HUD & Basic Mechanics</h2>
                <p class="body">While on a mission, you can never be certain about what's going to happen from drop-in to extraction, so you need to be ready for anything. Let's start out with what you'll see on the HUD, and how to keep yourself alive. In the bottom left corner of your screen, you can see the stats of everybody in the cave, mostly their health. The bottom right corner will show the ammo of the current weapon in your hands, how many grenades you've got left, and the current progress of your flares. As to make sure you can't abuse being able to see all the time, you can only have a max of 4 flares at any point in time, but they recharge on a timer. You also cannot hold any more ammo than your character is able to. While that max amount can be upgraded at the weapons station, you WILL NOT be able to resupply that ammo until you can bring in a resupply pod for the group. Bullets aren't cheap though, and DRG acknowledges this, so in order for them to drop in a supply pod, you'll need to mine and deposit 80 Nitra per pod. Each pod only has 4 charges, and each charge gives you 50% of the max ammo for everything in your inventory, including your grenades and support items like the gunner's zipline launcher and the scout's flare gun. Resupplying ammo can be something that'll make or break the mission depending on the moment, so make sure you communicate how you want to distribute the ammo. To make this easier, holding open your laser pointer will show you how much ammo everybody in the team has, so if you're unsure whether someone should take more than one charge from the resupply, this can help. Another important thing to note is that when you run out of health, you don't die. Your character will go down and can be revived, but having multiple people revive someone will make it go by faster. In order to keep your health up, keep an eye out around the cave for a red, glowing crystal. This is red sugar, and is the ONLY way to heal yourself other than a resupply. Upgrades to your suit and equipping perks will give you more health, and various ways to make your dwarf better suit your playstyle. Faster revives, throwing flares and heavy objects farther, even being able to tame a glyphid grunt and have it be a temporary pet! Buying and upgrading your perks will cost stars that you earn from completeing milestones, which you can do by effectively just playing the game.</p>

                <h2 class="header">Basic Controls</h2>
                <p class="body">Now that we've gotten past the basics of how to stay alive, let's go over the controls of the game. Please note that these controls are going to be for keyboard and mouse, as that's the platform that <i>I</i> play the game on. If you play the game on console, the in-game tutorial would most likely do a better job than me. To start, there are the basic keybinds of walking around with WASD, left shift to sprint, shooting your gun with left click, using R to reload, and using E to interact with objects. However, there is no aiming down sights, so holding right click lets you swing your pickaxe to break terrain, mine minerals, or even do damage to the enemy that's in front of you, though I will note that it's not much. Upgrading your pickaxe will allow you to do what's known as a "power attack," which is a much stronger swing of your pickaxe that recharges every 30 seconds, and can be done by left clicking while swinging your pickaxe. Using your scroll wheel or pressing any of the number keys from 1 to 4 will let you rotate through your weapons, and to potentially make it easier on yourself, remember that scrolling up will go to the right, and scrolling down goes to the left. I was definitely confused by this, so I'm telling you now just in case. Getting your precious minerals back safely and making sure you can bring back more, the company issue M.U.L.E, more commonly reffered to as "Molly," is your one-stop-shop to making sure the job gets done. Molly will follow you around whenever you get too far from her, but a single press of the C key will plant a beacon, and force Molly to move to that spot so that you can deposit all of your minerals. Getting lost is going to be something that'll happen a lot, which is where your map comes in. Holding tab will keep your terrain scanner open, showing where you've been, where the team is, and where certain points of interest are, such as the drop pod, pieces of rival technology, infected terrain, and more. Note that the terrain scanner will only stay open if you keep the button held down, and you'll stop your movement and drop any heavy items you're holding when you do, so make sure you know what's going on around you before looking. Being able to communicate with your teammates is also crucial to the game, whether you're with your friends or online randoms, so there are a few ways to do best communicate depending on what you're trying to do. If you're trying to tell your teammates where a certain object or point of interest is, hold the left ctrl button to pull out the laser pointer. The screen on the laser pointer will tell you the name of what you're looking at, and will also outline all of your teammates as long as you have it out, so if you ever get lost, pull out the laser pointer. Left clicking with the laser pointer will ping what you're looking at to your crew, no matter where they are. If you just want to get your teammates attentions, press X to shout out. If you want to celebrate the completion of an objective or turn everybody into a temporary smooth-brained idiot, press V to salute and have your character say the game's tagline catchphrase of "ROCK AND STONE!" I can guarantee you that if the people you're playing with are true dwarves, a single "Rock and Stone" will result in EVERYBODY spamming it, and that's one of the many special aspects about this game.</p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="header">Extraction Off Hoxxes</h2>
                <p class="body">Once you complete your primary objective, or objectives if the circumstances require it, the button to tell mission control to send in the drop pod will be available for your activation. Finish the interaction and they'll send down the drop pod to get you out. The drop pod will drop in a randomized spot in the cave, and once it does, you'll have 5 minutes to get to the drop pod and get in. However, Deep Rock values the minerals over the meatbags, and they're not going to let you return until Molly is in the drop pod and secured. Once she's in, the doors will open to take you home. Also, it is important to note that some missions will have different criteria when it comes to extracting. Some will give you less time to get in, some will require you to wait longer until the pod drops, certain missions bring some uncertaincies. You can find the details on the <a href="missions.html">missions</a> page.</p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="header">Levels & Promotions</h2>
                <p class="body">There are two different types of levels: Player Level and Class Level. Your player level will always increase as you play the game, no matter what you do and what class you play as, while your class level only goes up when you complete missions as that class. There are a variety of different assignments, cosmetics, upgrades, and even more that can only be unlocked once your player level or certain class level gets high enough. For example, you can unlock one of your weapon assignments for the driller by reaching level 8, but you don't unlock the level 8 weapon assignments for the other classes until you get that class to the same level. Once you level up a class to level 25, you get access to the promotion assignment for that class, and upon completing that assignment, you can promote that class with the right materials, reseting them to level 1 and giving you a variety of special items known as overclocks. Overclocks are special upgrades you can give weapons you've given at least one upgrade in each tier, only accessible after your first ever promotion. Some give minor boosts, some give upsides with some downsides, and some can change a weapon entirely. However, overclocks are incredibly expensive to make, so if you're looking to purchase an overclock, make sure you're ready to commit to that purchase.</p>
