                <p class="body">Hoxxes IV is a planet filled with an incalculable amount of valuable resources, but it's going to take you quite some effort in order to earn your paycheck. Some missions are as simple as finding and depositing a mineral or resource, while some are so complicated that it can take you upwards of 30 minutes before you can even BEGIN to complete your primary objective. Thankfully, no mission is so complicated that completion is an impossibility, but each mission has different completion processes, which is where some guidance will most definitely be required to help make things go smoothly.</p>
                <h2 class="header">Your Pain is Your Preference</h2>
                <p class="body">While the actual contents of the mission is up to the game's random cave generation, you have a say in how difficult the presets of that mission will be. There are three different factors that change how the events of a mission will go: Hazard Level, Biome, and Mutators.
                <br>
                <br>
                Hazard level can be changed at your own discretion from 1 to 5, though hazard level 5 is such a colossal danger that you need to complete a separate assignment just to gain access to it in the first place. Each hazard level you go up will increase the difficulty, but will also increase the rewards you get by 25%, with hazard 1 being a 25% increase, hazard 4 being a 100% increase, and hazard level 5 being a 133% increase in rewards. Only you know what you can and cannot handle with your loadouts, so make sure you communicate what hazard level you want to run wisely.
                <br>
                <br>
                Biomes and mutators will change when the missions rotate at the :00 and :30 minute marks of every hour. Some locations will not be available at certain times due to them being out of range from the planetary scanner, and each biome has different flora and enemy variants that can appear. Take for example the Glyphid Praetorian. In most biomes, the praetorian is his normal self, but the glacial strata and radioactive exclusion zone will each have praetorians that match its environment. Almost every biome also has some sort of hazard that's exclusive to it that can inhibit your vision, movement, or both. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Take into account the various mutators that can also be a part of your mission, and your mission could be incredibly dangerous. There are two kinds of mutators: warnings and anomalies. Warnings are the red colored mutators that bring negative side effects and make your mission harder, but also give you a boost in profits upon mission completion. Some of these include an electrical disturbance that disables your shield for the entire mission, much more dangerous enemies, and in increase in a specific type of enemy. There are more than a dozen warnings possible, and there can even be two warnings at once on a mission, so unless you KNOW you can handle each warning indivdually, I advise extreme caution on double warning missions. On the other side of the spectrum are the yellow anomalies with their positive side effects that will make your mission much easier or more valuable. Examples of these anomalies include a lot of gold in the cave, lower gravity, longer mineral veins, and critical hits doing much more damage. For more details on these mutations, the ingame Miner's Manual will give you a brief summary of each mutation.

                    <img class="mission-logo" src="Mission Logos/Mining_expedition_icon.png">
                    <p class="body">Mining expedition missions are the first missions that you gain access to, and are the most basic. Mission control has picked up large deposits of gold and a special mineral called Morkite deeper down in the cave, and you've been sent in to bring it back. The cave you'll be in will be a linear series of smaller caves that are separated by dirt walls, with a large room at the end filled with resources. The primary objective of these missions is for you to reach your quota of morkite and call in the drop pod, as well as your optional secondary objective if you want more credits. Once you do, press the button on the back of the MULE, and the drop pod will be called in. Once it lands, you'll have 5 minutes to get in the drop pod and extract for mission completion.</p>
                    <h3 class="tips-header">Tips & Tricks:</h3>
                    <ul class="tips-body">
                        <li>Morkite can be found in almost every cave section you're in, not just the end room, so keep your eyes peeled!</li>
                        <li>Given its unique properties, morkite has a special blue shine that can be seen in the dark, so if you're unsure if you're looking at morkite, look for a wavy blue glow and a blocky appearance.</li>
                        <li>Morkite doesn't do anything outside of the objective, so you don't really need to mine anymore after you've hit your quota.</li>

                    <img class="mission-logo" src="Mission Logos/Egg_collection_icon.webp">
                    <p class="body">Egg Hunts are another of the simpler missions, and are similar to mining expeditions. Managment wants you to collect alien eggs, we don't know what kind and we don't know why, but managment wants them, so you've gotta do it. You'll drop into a central room with various pathways that will lead you to the eggs, and you can go in any order. The eggs are hiding inside of large orbs of a pinkish-purple biomass, visible by the visible tendrils on the walls nearby and their orange glow. On top of this, eggs can be seen on your terrain scanner with ease, all that's left is you heading over and grabbing them. The biomass holding the eggs has an incredbily thin membrane that can br broken in one hit, and you'll almost always find the egg in the center. Break the egg out with a couple whacks of your pickaxe, and you'll hear a very loud roar in the distance, causing your screen to shake and a small group of glyphids to spawn nearby. There is also a chance for a swarm to spawn upon breaking out the eggs, and these swarms can happen in consecutive order, so take caution when grabbing eggs, you may spawn multiple swarms at once. Get all the eggs, deposit them in the MULE, then call in a drop pod and get out.</p>
                    <h3 class="tips-header">Tips & Tricks:</h3>
                    <ul class="tips-body">
                        <li>The eggs are incredibly easy to find, no matter where you are in relation to them. You can find them on your map at all times, the indicator for showing they're behind a wall is incredibly obvious, and the glow can be seen very easily in the dark, all you need to figure out is how to get there and break the eggs.</li>
                        <li>If an egg causes a swarm to approach, the game will not cause them to spawn near instantaneously like the small groups do when normally pull an egg out. Eggs that spawn a swarm will still cause the game to spawn the swarm in the way its supposed to, giving you time to deposit the egg and prepare, so use your time wisely.</li>
                        <li>Always make sure you're ready before pulling an egg out, the swarms spawn chances are always random, and no two missions will spawn swarms the same, at least not in close succession that you'll remember it.</li>
                    </ul>

                <div id="on-siteRefining">
                    <h2 class="subheader">On-site Refining</h2>
                    <img class="mission-logo" src="Mission Logos/Refining_icon.webp">
                    <p class="body">On-site Refining is one of the more complicated missions, and requires much more time to complete, but is also one of the more valuable missions. Three wells of liquid morkite have been found in the area, and you'll need to set up the refinery to grab as much of it as you can. This is one of the two missions where you will not have access to the MULE to deposit, and will have to return to the on-site refinery whenever you need to deposit. Mission control will drop the refinery in a certain area of the cave, and you'll need to find the wells of liquid morkite, get a pumpjack dropped onto it, and then build a pipeline from the refinery to those pumpjacks. However, you can't just go building all willy nilly with these pipelines, there are four main restraints that you'll need to follow with each segment of pipes. Each pipeline connector needs to be built on applicable ground, cannot be more than 9 meters away from the last one, cannot be blocked by terrain, and cannot cause the pipe to be at too sharp of an angle. Thankfully, your character holds a small device in their hands when building pipelines that tell you if there will be any problems. Once you get all three pipelines connected to the refinery, start up the machinery and get extracting. The noise will cause the bugs to keep heading your way, so you'll need to keep fighting them off while the extraction is underway. Even worse is that the bugs will attack the pipelines, causing them to jam twice. Find which parts are broken, repair them, and the refinery will eventually be filled to the brim with liquid morkite. Launch the oil well into orbit, and mission control will bring down the drop pod. NOTE: Since you don't have the MULE, you will only have 3 minutes to get to the drop pod, since mission control is only waiting on you to get there, not Molly too.</p>
                    <h3 class="tips-header">Tips & Tricks:</h3>
                    <ul class="tips-body">
                        <li>The morkite wells have a specific sound and visual indicator to help you find where they are. Listen for the sounds of rumbling and an occasional burst of blue fire to make finding the wells much faster.</li>
                        <li>I would recommend finding all of the wells and getting all of the pumpjacks down first, since you can use your laser pointer or terrain scanner to find them if you get lost mid pipe construction.</li>
                        <li>Drillers and Engineers are very recommended for more complicated and difficult on-site refining missions. Caves with more complex layouts can make laying pipelines a massive hassle without the Driller's potential shortcuts through terrain or the Engineer's platform gun to help scale wonky terrain. Engi's sentry guns can also make defending the refinery much easier on yourselves. If you can, I would at least recommend one of both on these missions.</li>

                    <img class="mission-logo" src="Mission Logos/Salvage_icon.png">
                    <p class="body">While having rather simple objectives, salvage missions are another of the longer missions in the game. A previous crew was in this cave, and lost their drop pod, their mini MULEs, and their lives, and you have the responsibility of bringing everything back (minus the crew). First thing you should do is explore the cave to find the mini MULEs, as you cannot progress until they're fixed. These mini MULEs can be found by either a beeping noise, or a green spherical light that pulses with the beeping. Once you do, you'll need to reattatch any legs the mini MULEs are missing, and then repair it entirely. The legs can easily be found by yourself, as they have a bright light around them, but if you're struggling to find them, interacting with one of the MULEs will show nearby legs on your terrain scanner. Find the legs, break them out of the ground and carry them to the legs to get them fixed up.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Once you repair all the mini MULEs in the cave, interact with the button on Molly, and all MULEs will head back to the lost drop pod. Your next main objective is to fix this drop pod and ride it back to the space rig, though you'll only have one shot, so these next steps are top priority. The first step to repairing the drop pod is to start up a communications uplink, allowing mission control to triangulate your position and find you. To start the triangulation process, look for a rectangular green box near the drop pod and interact with it. Once it starts, you'll need to stay close to the box within a small radius, visible by a green staticy zone. It's important to note that the process will slow down with less teammates, so having everyone on the team there will have it go the fastest. Completing the triangulation will start the next step: refueling the drop pod. Mission control will drop you fresh fuel cells for the drop pod nearby, and you'll need to connect them to the pod, similar to on-site refining pipes. Once you do, head back to the cells and start them up, repeating the same procedure the triangulation process has. Once you complete refueling, you'll need to wait another two minutes for the drop pod to start itself up, and once it does, you'll only have one minute to board.</p>
                    <h3 class="tips-header">Tips & Tricks:</h3>
                    <ul class="tips-body">
                        <li>Most, if not all of the time, the mini MULEs will be in the same part of the cave as the drop pod, and to make things easier, the broken drop pod can be seen at all times on your terrain scanner.</li>
                        <li>Many experienced players like to build "bunkers" around the triangualtion and fuel cell objectives with the engineer's platforms for the sake of safety and ease of completion. Though sometimes, these may backfire, as glyphids and enemies could still spawn in there, turning it into more of a kill chamber instead of a bunker.</li>
                        <li>Engineers are also good to have on the team solely for their sentry guns, with the right upgrades and placements, the sentry turrets can keep the entire outside of your objective covered without you needing to leave and waste progression rates.</li>

                    <p class="body">Another simple yet sometimes annoying mission, point extraction missions are effectively a scavenger hunt with minerals. The other mission where you do not have access to the MULE, you'll be supplied with a large central platform known as a minehead that has two deposit points, a few pairs of floodlights, and three turrets to help supply covering fire. The basic premise is that the cave you're in is filled with multiple amounts of a valuable mineral known as an Aquarq that are stuck in the walls of the cave. These aquarqs can be found by looking for flecks of blue shimmering crystal and digging them out. Once you do, bring it back to the minehead and deposit it to get closer towards your quota. Once the quota is reached, you can interact with a button on the platform to launch the minehead into orbit, where you'll have to wait two minutes before the drop pod arrives. Once it does, you'll have three minutes to get in and extract.</p>
                    <h3 class="tips-header">Tips & Tricks:</h3>
                    <ul class="tips-body">
                        <li>While it may seem like a good idea to look for the dig spots first and dig them out later, it's very likely you'll forget where it is later, so dig out any aquarqs you come across. Any aquarqs you dug out that are not deposited will appear on your terrain scanner, meaning you'll always know where it is and can come back to it later.</li>
                        <li>If getting in and getting out is what you're looking for, bringing a Driller is a no brainer, as their power drills can make quick work of the aquarqs with their superior digging speed and area compared to the pickaxe.</li>
                        <li>If you're struggling to find the aquarq you're digging for, look for a faint blue glow and dig towards it. This glow indicates the physical position of the aquarq in the wall, so always make sure you're digging towards this glow.</li>

                    <p class="body">Escort Duty missions are another mission type that is much longer in nature, but also gives you a large amount of credits. Deep Rock Galactic has detected what's known as an Ommoran Heartstone nearby, and you need to escort and maintain the machinery that will help you get it. Shortly after dropping into the cave, a Drilldozer will drop nearby for you to start up. The drilldozer will automatically hone in on the heartstone, you'll just need to protect and repair the drilldozer while it's digging. The drilldozer has three body sections that will be permanently broken after enough damage, with the left side taking damage first, then the right, then the main chassis. If the main chassis reaches 0%, you'll automatically fail the mission, so the dozer is top priority. After enough time, the dozer will be out of fuel and you'll need to refuel it. Head to the back of the drilldozer to grab the fuel canisters and fill them up with the nearby oil shale by "shooting" the oil with the cansiter. Once full, put the cansiters back in the dozer and start it back up.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Once you reach the heartstone, you'll need to prepare yourself for a four phase "boss fight" where the drilldozer breaks through the shell of the heartstone. Each phase will take longer than the last, and the even numbered phases introduce a new mechanic. Phase one is just protecting the drilldozer from swarms, while phase two will have the Ommoran Heartstone attempting to throw large rocks at the drilldozer, though you can shoot them down to destroy them. Phase three is the same as phase one, and phase four will have the heartstone creating crystal pillers that blast constant lasers at the drilldozer, and you'll need to physically destroy them yourself. Once you get past phase four, the shell will be broken, the drilldozer will have served its purpose and self destruct, and the heartstone can be deposited. Interact with the button on the MULE to call in the drop pod and extract.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="tips-header">Tips & Tricks:</h3>
                    <ul class="tips-body">
                        <li>The drilldozer will move in a predetermined path every time it starts up towards the heartstone, and the drill will kill anything it comes in contact with and scare other nearby enemies away.</li>
                        <li>Not every part of the drill dozer has a physical hitbox for glyphids, and they'll tend to clip into the harder spots that you can't reach very well, so be sure to keep a keen eye out if you're unsure what's exactly damaging the dozer.</li>
                        <li>Much like how the dwarves nickname the MULE "Molly," the Drilldozer is given the nickname of "Doretta." You can also grab the drilldozer's head and bring it back to the drop pod after it explodes at the end of the mission. You don't get a reward for it, but it's still something people like to do because they can.</li>
                        <li>An Engineer's sentry guns can be useful tools to help protect the dozer during swarms and when you need to stray from it to do something else, just make sure to keep the ammo count in check and not forget to still check the dozer if you wander off for too long. Your hubris can and will come back to bite you.</li>

                    <p class="body">Elimination missions are perhaps the most physically challenging missions in the entirety of Deep Rock Galactic. Your objective is to find and kill multiple Glyphid Dreadnoughts, the most dangerous of the glyphid species, before they eventually become something worse, forcing DRG to close operations in the area. The dreadnoughts can be found pupating in their cocoons, which can always be found on your terrain scanner. Find your way over, break the cocoon, and you'll fight one of three randomly chosen dreadnought variants: the Glyphid Dreadnought, the Dreadnought Hiveguard, and the Dreadnought Twins. More information on these enemies can be found on the <a href="enemies.html">enemies</a> page. Once you eliminate all dreadnoughts in the area, you can bring in the drop pod and extract. Elimination missions are incredibly easy in terms of your objectives, but fighting dreadnoughts requires a lot of ammo and time, making these missions incredibly challenging on higher difficulties.</p>
                    <h3 class="tips-header">Tips & Tricks:</h3>
                    <ul class="tips-body">
                        <li>Dreadnought cocoons can spawn anywhere in the cave, including in a tight hallway. If you can, I recommend luring the dreadnought over to a much bigger area to make fighting them much less of a hassle.</li>
                        <li>Cocoons take damage from anything that deals it, including your pickaxes and weapons. Being crushed by something like an incoming drop pod can also cause the cocoon to break, so make sure to be careful with the positioning.</li>
                        <li>Dreadnoughts are incredibly resistant to status effects like burning and freezing, making the gunner the best option to fight, since all of his weapons shoot actual bullets and are meant for pure damage.</li>

                    <p class="body">Industrial Sabotage missions are the most unique misson in Deep Rock Galactic, as it was introduced in Season 1 and requires that you complete the coresponding assignment before you get permanent access to the mission for yourself. The premise of this mission is that a rival company has been trying their hand on Hoxxes, and managment is furious at this. They've sent you in personally to trash whatever they've set up in this cave and take whatever you can for DRG's benefit. Shortly after leaving the drop pod, you'll come across a large data vault that's protected by a large impenetrable force field, so you'll need to take down the power stations that are powering them. You can find these stations by following the power cables that lead off of the force field's projector.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Once you find one of the power stations, interact with it to call in a hacking pod from mission control. This hacking pod will drop anywhere that's kind of close to the hacking pod, requiring you to set up transmitter nodes that allow the hacking pod to connect to the power station. These pods can be placed anywhere, but need to be placed within a certain radius of the last rod, visible by a green sphere. However, if there is any terrain blocking the way, the connection cannot connect to that node, so some digging or placement changing may need to happen. Once the hacking pod is connected to the power station, interact with a button on the pod to start the hacking process. A robot named HACK-C (Hacksy) will be doing his best to hack his way into the station, but not without attracting some unwanted attention from bugs and the rival company's drones. Keep Hacksy protected for long enough, and the hack will be successful. Repeat this process with the other power station, and you can disable the force field.

                    However, there's one last hoop you'll need to jump through before you can raid the data vault. Upon disabling the force field, you'll activate The Caretaker, a three stage boss fight that can be incredibly difficult on higher hazard levels. While the caretaker himself doesn't really do much, he gets a lot of help from other enemies like the robotic appendages on the data vault, and spawning in more enemies in later phases. In order to deal damage to the caretaker, you'll need to disable all four vents at the top by shooting them. Once all four vents are disabled, the caretaker will open one of its eyes, indicated by the large red light coming from that eye. Dealing enough damage will deplete one of his health bars and start the next phase, where he can spawn sniper turrets and/or shredder drones, or teleport in phase bombs, making the fight more difficult. Repeating this 2 more times will kill the caretaker, finishing the fight and finally allowing you to take the data rack. Strap it to Molly and you'll be able to bring in a drop pod to take you home.

                    <ul class="tips-body">
                        <li>Every class has some part of the mission where they can come in handy, just know that a majority of the mission relies on your weapons, and some classes guns are better at being damage dealers than others, so make sure you choose your loadout wisely.</li>
                        <li>During the caretaker fight, that section of the cave will have a constant, yet rather dim light keeping the cave lit up at all times, allowing you to spend less time getting caught on terrain and struggling to survive and focus more on fighting the caretaker itself.</li>
                        <li>There will rarely be a moment in the caretaker fight for you to catch your breath, so it's a good idea to drop supply pods before the fight, and in multiple places so that there's one available wherever you may need it, and to constantly keep moving to make sure you minimize damage taken.</li>

                    <p class="body">Deep Dives are the hardest missions available, but they give some incredible rewards. Once you get your first promotion, you gain access to normal deep dives, three back-to-back missions in the same biome with two primary objectives that need to be completed before going to the next. All three missions are the exact same every time you run it, and the deep dive rotates every week. On top of this, none of the <a href="randomEvents.html">random events</a> are able to spawn in on these missions, alongside a variety of valuable items. Mutators have a much higher chance of appearing on these missions, and your health, ammo, and team depository transfer over between the three missions. These deep dives also have very strict rules, where no one can join in late after the mission begins or join back if they leave. There are also elite deep dives, which are significantly harder, but will also give you more rewards. Deep dives are incredibly hard, but they are meant to be a challenge for those who have earned access to it. Enter if you dare, for fortune favors the bold.</p>
