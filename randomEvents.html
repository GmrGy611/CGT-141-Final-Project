                <h1 class="title">Random Events</h1>
                <p class="body">The caves can hold a myriad of surprises outside of the hordes of enemies and interesting landscapes that you'll come across, and each of these has their own sorts of rewards. From cosmetic items to dress up your dwarves and weapons, to seasonal items that give you a bounty of experience and credits, and depositing the item for the current season will reward you with a scrip to progress in the cosmetics tree after depositing enough of them. Note that not all of these events are a requirement, most of them are just an optional side job you can do in the middle of your mission, but the rewards are worth the effort most of the time.</p>

                    <img id="crate-image" src="Random Events/Cargo Crate.png">
                    <p class="body">While its unknown as to how these crates got here in the first place, it doesn't mean you can't reap the benefits for yourself. However, the batteries that power the cargo crates have gone missing, and are somwhere around the cave. Dig them out of the ground, carry them over to the crate, plug them in, and repair the crate to gain access to whatever rewards lie inside. A variety of cosmetic items can be earned from crates, such as weapon and armor skins, pickaxe parts, and skins for Bosco, the drone that accompanies you when you go solo on a mission.</p>

                    <img id="pack-image" src="Random Events/Lost Pack.jpg">
                    <p class="body">At some other point in time, another crew set out on an expedition in the cave you're in, and whether they lost their lives or just their armor, they're not using it anymore. In order to find the pack that they lost, you'll first need to find the helmet that has the coordinates, easily found by the beeping noise that it makes and glowing orange pulse when it makes these beeps. Find the helmet, interact with it to get the coordinates transferred to your terrain scanner, and then go find the pack. It may have been behind you, it may be closer towards the end of the cave, the spawn of this pack is completely random, but what's always the same is that you'll need to dig your way through the terrain to grab the loot that's left in the pack.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="dataCell">
                    <h2 class="header">Data Cell</h2>
                    <img id="dataCell-image" src="Random Events/Data Cell.webp">
                    <p class="body">The most valuable thing to get from the rival company's technology, the data cell contains the data that they have gathered about Hoxxes IV, and we can't have them using that data to take Hoxxes for themselves. There are currently three ways to obtain a data cell: destroying a prospector drone, hacking a data deposit, and disabling a communications router. You can read up on how to destroy a prospector drone in the <a href="enemies.html">enemies</a> page, but the other two will require some more explanation.
                    <br><br>
                    Hacking a data deposit is the same as hacking a power station in an industrial sabotage mission, where you'll need to call down and connect a hacking pod to the data deposit, and then protect the hacking drone as it breaks through the data deposit's firewalls. Once the hacking drone successfully hacks its way through the deposit, you'll finally have access to the data cell, so make sure to deposit it in the MULE as fast as you can. The communications relay, though, will take a lot more effort to complete. To start the process of disabling it, you'll need to break the relays on the router, but doing so will start the self destruct sequence, giving you only three minutes to fully disable the router and access the data cell. You'll have 30 seconds to find the blinking antenna and defuse it in the allotted time before it randomly switches to another antenna. Disable enough antennas before the self destruct sequence goes off to get the data cell.</p>

                <div id="machineEvents">
                    <h2 class="header">Machine Events</h2>
                    <p class="body">Only accessible after promoting your first dwarf, machine events are one of your main ways to obtain overclocks for your weapons. Overclocks are ways to modify your weapons in ways that the normal upgrades cannot normally do, and range from upgrading your weapon stats even more to completely changing the way the weapon works. You can find machine events randomly in your cave, and there are four different events that could spawn: Ebonite Mutation, Kursite Infection, Tritilyte Crystal and Omen Modular Exterminator. You can start these events by using the tritilyte key you obtain on promotion into the core infuser, which is the small white box you'll find nearby. Insert the key, and start up all four betteries to start up the event. Upon completion, as long as you have at least one blank matrix core, you can insert one into the infuser and choose between three randomly generated overclocks. Take caution though, some of these events are much harder and more dangerous than others, so make sure you're prepared regardless of which one it is.</p>

                    <h3 class="subheader">Ebonite Mutation</h3>
                    <img class="machineEvent-image" src="Random Events/Ebonite Mutation.webp">
                    <p class="body">Arguably the easiest of the machine missions, local grunts and praetorians have a certain mutation that has caused their skin to be covered in dense, rock-like growths, meaning that they can only be damaged by melee attacks, including the power drills and the Driller's impact axes. To make up for this, an overcharge sprinkler will be nearby to constantly produce blue glowing pickups that greatly reduce the cooldown on your power attack, making quick work of any ebonite enemies that come your way. Earn enough points by killing ebonite enemies and you'll complete the event.</p>

                    <h3 class="subheader">Kursite Infection</h3>
                    <img class="machineEvent-image" src="Random Events/Kursite Infection.webp">
                    <p class="body">The Kursite Infection event is very similar to the ebonite event, but with some key differences. For starters, the enemies you'll encounter during this <i>can</i> be killed by normal gunfire, and will drop a large chunk of the kursite they are infected by upon death. In order to progress and complete the event, you'll need to deposit these samples into the grinder. Only one type of infected enemy will show up, either the glyphid acid spitter, glyphid praetorian, or mactera spawn. It's important to make sure you kill the infected enemies when they are close to the grinder to make carrying the samples less of an annoyance and clear the event faster. Make sure to be quick though, as these samples will decay and disappear after a short period of time. Deposit the required amount, and you'll complete the event.</p>

                    <h3 class="subheader">Tritilyte Crystal</h3>
                    <img class="machineEvent-image" src="Random Events/Tritilyte Crystal.webp">
                    <p class="body">One of the more difficult events, your main objective is to destroy the large tritilyte crystal, which is too dense for the lasers surrounding it to do themselves. Thankfully, mission control has a nanite bomb dispenser to drop into the cave for you to destroy it with. The destruction of the crystal with the bombs is simple: Walk to the dispenser, pick up a bomb, and then throw it at the crystal when you're close enough to start chipping away at its health. However, these bombs are considered a heavy object, meaning you cannot defend yourself unless you drop or throw the bomb, so if you ever get overwhelmmed by enemies, don't be discouraged to throw the bomb at an enemy, they deal incredible damage. Rinse and repeat this process until the crystal is gone to complete the event.</p>

                    <h3 class="subheader">Omen Modular Exterminator</h3>
                    <img class="machineEvent-image" src="Random Events/Omen Tower.webp">
                    <p class="body">Without a doubt the hardest machine event to complete, the Omen Modular Exterminator is a stack of three randomly chosen modules that need to have their cooling tanks destroyed before they are destroyed entirely. To gain access to these cooling tanks, stand on the maintenance platforms around the tower for a couple seconds and the tanks will be visible. The modules that can appear can be any of the following:</p>
                        <ul id="omenModules">
                            <li>The Drone Replicator, which will constantly deploy explosive bomb drones that will always home in on you, regardless of whether or not the last bomb has exploded yet. These bombs can be shot out of the air despite their small appearance.</li>
                            <li>The Heavy Burster, which constantly looks for any targets that enter its red light, shooting them with its machine gun until it leaves the light.</li>
                            <li>The Twin Slicer, which has a pair of lasers that constantly rotate around and aim at various heights. These lasers will not always be pointed at the ground though, making it easy to avoid. The only module with 2 tanks.</li>
                            <li>The Radial Pulse-Gun will always be on the bottom, rapidly rotating and launching wide projectiles in three directions that are slow moving but incredibly damaging. Take this one out first, they can tear you apart like you're pulled pork.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <p class="body">With how random the apearance of the modules are, how incredibly dangerous their attacks are, and how surprisingly effective they are at working together, the more experienced players of DRG would recommend that you avoid these thing entirely, and I'm definitely in that group. They can feel like a waste of time and effort with how common it is that someone will go down, and when you're going solo, where Bosco only has a certain number of revives, Omen towers can be run killers in the wrong situations. Unless you're in a team of at least three players, avoid them all together, just don't bother.

                <div id="lithophageMeteors">
                    <h2 class="header">Lithophage Meteors</h2>
                    <img id="meteor-image" src="Random Events/Lithophage Meteorite.jpg">
                    <p class="body"> NOTE: The current chances for lithophage meteors to spawn are much higher than everything else, as we're still in a season related to lithophage. Once the game moves on to the next season, their spawn chances will decrease to be the same as the data cell events.
                    <br><br>    
                    The newest event that came from Season 3, the meteor that contains the rockpox lithophage has begun breaking into various meteorites that all contain plaguehearts, allowing the virus to spread throughout the caves. There are two variations of meteorites that can happen in your caves: Meteorite chunks and an entire meteorite. Each of these has their own audio cue to them spawning, so make sure to keep an ear out. The meteorite chunks are the simpler of the two, where all you'll need to do is find the chunks and break them open with your pickaxe. Only one or two of them will contain the plagueheart, and will cause your infection buildup to increase as long as you're carrying it, so make sure your point of deposit is close, or just drop the plagueheart every now and then.
                    <br><br>
                    The entire meteorite will require a lot more work for a lot more rewards. This meteorite is obviously much too large for your pickaxe to break, so you'll need to call up mission control to drop you a pair of rock cracker pods. Once they land, connect the power line from the pods to both spots on the meteor, build the jackhammers, and the rock cracking process will start. However, the rock cracker pods' durability will decrease as the process goes on, so you'll need to run over to them and keep them in stable condition for the rock cracking to go as fast as it can. On top of that, all of the noise the jackhammers make attracts various swarms of bugs, and they don't exactly like it. This means you'll need to make sure the swarms don't attack the pods and break them down much faster. Just make sure to keep your cool and constantly check up on the pods, and you'll crack the meteorite in no time. Once its open, there will be 3-4 plaguehearts inside to deposit, and the bugs will back off.

                <div id="creatureEncounters">
                    <h2>Creature Encounters</h2>
                    <p class="body">Not all missions you go on will have every enemy possible show up, because I think everyone can agree that this would be way too annoying and feel unfair. Thankfully, the enemies that are much more dangerous have much smaller spawn chances than those that are more beneficial. To see how they all work, make sure to check the <a href="enemies.html">enemies</a> page.
                    <br>
                    The current spawn chances for these rarer creatures are as follow:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>BET-C:</b> 5% Chance</li>
                        <li><b>Dreadnought:</b> 1.5% Chance (Non-Elimination Missions)</li>
                        <li><b>Crassus Detonator:</b> 3% Chance</li>
