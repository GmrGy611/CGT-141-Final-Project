                <p class="body">The company of Deep Rock Galactic is an incredibly diverse one, taking in dwarves no matter the shapes, sizes, or appearance. However, some people just have an attraction to certain things. Whether it be overwhelming firepower and rate of fire, to tools of technology, certain people fall into certain groups. Therein lie the four main playable classes available to run through Hoxxes with: Gunner, Driller, Engineer and Scout. However, each is much more different than you may think, which is where you'll need some more explanation.</p>
                <h2 class="header">Shared Similarities</h2>
                <p class="body">Some pieces of equipment are shared between each class, such as flares, shields and an armor rig. While everything can be uprgaded to better fit your playstyle, excluding flares, no dwarf is ever at a real disatvantage in terms of pure stats. Each dwarf's base health and shield is the same, each dwarf's armor rig has the same upgrades, with the exception of one, and other statistics such as running speed and pickaxe swinging speed are all the same. The only real differences between the dwarves are their weapons and tools.</p>
                <br>

                <div id="gunner">
                    <h2 id="gunner-header">The Gunner</h2>
                    <img id="gunner-image" src="Dwarf Renders/Gunner_Render.png">
                    <p class="body">The heavy weapons specialist of Deep Rock Galactic, the gunner is the man you want on the frontlines when there's a swarm barreling your way. The gunner's primaries all fall into the genral ballpark of being incredibly heavy weaponry that can pack a serious punch via accuracy-by-volume, while his secondaries all focus on taking their damage and focusing it into a smaller and much more accurate area. If I had to compare the gunner to something from another game, I would best compare the Gunner to the Assault class from the Battlefield games, as both classes' purposes are built around using weapons that are built for maxing out the DPS and dealing a lot of damage.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Primaries</h3>
                    <img class="gunnerPrimary" src="Weapon Outlines/LeadStorm.webp">
                    <img class="gunnerPrimary" src="Weapon Outlines/Thunderhead.webp">
                    <img class="gunnerPrimary" src="Weapon Outlines/Hurricane.webp">
                    <p class="body">The "Leadstorm" Powered Machine gun is a triple barreled gatling gun capable of dispensing rounds at an RPM higher than any other primary available, and is the default primary that you start with. The gun has an internal drum barrel that it pulls ammo from, meaning that you can effectively fire indefintely if the gun didn't overheat. Firing for too long will cause the gun to overheat, making you unable to fire until it's done. This is visible via a small circular guage on the gun that will indicate how close you are to an overheat. The gun also has an admittedly slow spinup time, so make sure you pull the trigger in advance to make sure you don't take any unnecessary damage.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The "Thunderhead" Heavy Autocannon is a double barreled heavy weapon which is basically an artillery cannon you can walk with. The bullets it fires are explosive tipped, giving the gun some much needed AOE damage to take on swarms at least somewhat on par with the Leadstorm. However, what the Thunderhead brings in terms of sheer damage and AOE damaging bullets, it is also met with incredibly wide bullet spread and incredibly slow rate of fire. However, both of these can be upgraded to be much less severe, making the gun much more viable and cost effective on ammo.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The "Hurricane" Guided Rocket System is a portable rocket launcher/missile silo that launches smaller sized rockets that are always aimed in the same direction as your crosshair. Any rockets that are already fired will turn with you can keep flying forward, making sure your rockets can always hit your targets. However, these rockets admittedly do not fly very fast, though that can be upgraded, has a very slow rate of fire, and does not have as high of a DPS as the other primaries. Upgrades can increase these stats to make the weapon better, though in my opinion, needing all of the upgrades for it to feel viable to me does not feel like good weapon design.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Secondaries</h3>
                    <img class="gunnerSecondary" src="Weapon Outlines/Bulldog.webp">
                    <img class="gunnerSecondary" src="Weapon Outlines/Burst Pistol.webp">
                    <img class="gunnerSecondary" src="Weapon Outlines/Coilgun.webp">
                    <p class="body">The "Bulldog" Heavy Revolver is a four cylinder revolver loaded in 26mm rounds, effectively acting like a revolver loaded in shotgun slugs, and is the starting secondary. The bulldog is relatively accurate for the damage that it does, though a lack in magazine size and maximum ammo could be seen as a noticble downside. As long as you aim right and spec your upgrades correctly, the bulldog can take down almost any foe without being too costly with your ammo.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The BRT7 Burst Fire Gun is a pistol that fires in short burts, and is on par with the bulldog in terms of damage per burst. Despite the base spread and relatively strong recoil, the BRT7 is most definitely not lacking in its versatility. With base stats of a 3 round burst, magazine size of 24 and 120 max ammo, the amount of kills you can get with the gun may shock you. However, the BRT is also very lacking in terms of armor penetration, so any enemy larger than a glyphid grunt or mactera spawn may be hard to fight with the incorrect positioning. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The ArmsKore Coil Gun is a handheld rail gun capable of piercing through rock until it collides with its target. Incredibly heavy on single target damage, the coil gun is very good for dealing with larger enemies, and even small groups with upgrades. However, the gun needs to briefly charge itself before it can fire, and it cannot hold that charge for very long, so make sure the enemy you're targeting is well within your field of view, whether they're in your immediate field of view or not.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Tools</h3>
                    <img class="gunnerTool" src="Weapon Outlines/Zipline Launcher.webp">
                    <img class="gunnerTool" src="Weapon Outlines/Shield Gen.webp">
                    <p class="body">The Zipline Launcher is the gunner's movement tool that makes getting around much easier in terms of verticality. Though each zipline has a restriction on how long it is and what angle it goes at, you can make a zipline from point A to point B as easy as point and click. The downside to this ease of transportation, however, is that you move incredibly slow, and getting hit too hard/too much will cause you to fall off of the zipline, taking fall damage to boot. But, you can give yourself a speed boost when going down a zipline as long as it's going down at least 5 degrees.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The shield generator is the gunner's support item that when thrown down, will create a large safe zone that will keep all enemies out and regenerate your shield much faster and much more than it normally does. Once it runs out, the generator must return to the gunner and recharge before it can be used again. These generators are very useful in safely reviving teammates, resupplying, and giving yourself a breather when you're in a pinch.</p>

                <div id="driller">
                    <h2 id="driller-header">The Driller</h2>
                    <img id="driller-image" src="Dwarf Renders/Driller_Render.png">
                    <p class="body">No mining operation would be a mining operation if there wasn't at least someone designated as the guy that does all of the digging, and Deep Rock's man for the job is the driller. Much like the gunner, he has multiple heavy weapons available as primaries with much lighter secondaries, though the drillers weapons are much more varied and can deal various status effects while still being able to protect everyone, even if you're going solo. Also equipped with a pair of titanium power drills, ease of access and plowing through terrain is his specialty.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Primaries</h3>
                    <img class="drillerPrimary" src="Weapon Outlines/Flamethrower.webp">
                    <img class="drillerPrimary" src="Weapon Outlines/Cryo Cannon.webp">
                    <img class="drillerPrimary" src="Weapon Outlines/Sludge Pump.webp">
                    <p class="body">The CRSPR Flamethrower is the default primary that the driller starts out with. Though you may just think of it as "just a flamethrower," it's not lacking in its utility. While still doing damage to anything the flames touch, the flamethrower will also build up progress towards the enemy being set on fire. A small hexagon with a fire sign on it will slowly fill up next to the enemy's health bar, and will cause the enemy to take damage over time when full. On top of this, the flamethrower has a unique effect known as "sticky flames," where secondary flames will be left on any surface the flamethrower shoots for a few seconds.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Cryo Cannon is another primary weapon that's similar to the flamethrower. It has a brief wind up before it can be used, but it isn't nearly as bad as the Lead Storm's. On paper, it is essentially the flamethrower again but with ice, which is not entirely wrong, but there are some key differences. The cryo cannon doesn't need to "reload," rather it pulls from a tank when you stop shooting, and does not do as much damage. While the flamethrower is useful by being able to ignite certain gasses and doing DoT, the cryo cannon is useful by temporarily stopping enemies and killing ANY mactera enemy when they freeze, as the freezing causes them to fall out of the air and shatter.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Corrosive Sludge Pump is the one primary the driller has that <i>doesn't</i> work like the flamethrower. The sludge pump launches small balls of a corrosive material that will deal damage on contact, slow the enemy, and deal damage over time. Charging the attack will do more damage at the cost of more ammo, and when fully charged, will cause the projectile to break apart in random directions. Any projectile will leave behind a temporary puddle when it comes in contact with a surface, allowing the player to get crafty with the placement of said puddles. It is also important to note that the projectiles follow an arc, meaning that you will have to aim higher to compensate for distance.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Secondaries</h3>
                    <img class="drillerSecondary" src="Weapon Outlines/Subata.webp">
                    <img class="drillerSecondary" src="Weapon Outlines/Plasma Charger.webp">
                    <img class="drillerSecondary" src="Weapon Outlines/Wave Cooker.webp">
                    <p class="body">The Subata 120 pistol is the default secondary the driller uses, and is a semi-auto pistol capable of making up for the range the flamethrower lacks. The pistol itself is not very complicated of a weapon, all you really need to do is point and shoot, which makes it a very reliable secondary weapon. However, the pistol can feel like it eats through ammo if you're using the pistol and shooting it a lot, though the upgrades you can choose make the pistol much better in terms of ammo and damage.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Experimental Plasma Charger is a pistol-like plasma weapon that can be very good for single and group damage. The pistol pulls from one large pool of ammo and does not need to reload at the cost of overheating with too much usage. Firing the weapon normally produces small plasma balls that have to move through the world to reach its target and cause a small amount of heat generation. Charging the weapon will launch a much larger yet slower moving plasma ball capable of dealing damage within a small area, though it will constantly generate heat as long as you hold the charge. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Colette Wave Cooker is a heavy weapon secondary capable of dealing constant damage at an infinite range. Much like the plasma charger, it does not need to reload at the cost of jamming with too much heat. The actual beam is invisible, with you only being able to see the particles on whatever you're aiming at, but as long as your reticle is on an enemy, they will take damage. Just be cautious to watch the heat generation and your ammo, but overall, the wave cooker is another good all around secondary weapon.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Tools</h3>
                    <img class="drillerTool" src="Weapon Outlines/Power Drills.webp">
                    <img class="drillerTool" src="Weapon Outlines/Satchel Charge.webp">
                    <p class="body">The Titanium Power Drills are what make the driller, the driller. Capable of busting through any surface, getting through rough parts of your cave should be non-existant with one of these guys on your team. Though only having a limited amount of gas and being capable of overheating, drillers can make shortcuts from here to there wherever you need them. However, it is important to note that the drills cannot mine materials for you. You can break the surface they're on, but you'll still need to use your pickaxe to collect them.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The C4 Satchel Charge is the second support tool available to the driller, and compensates for his lack of general DPS by being able to blow up very large numbers of glyphids in a large radius. Pressing LMB once will let you throw down the charge, and pressing it again will detonate the charge, dealing damage to everything caught in the blast radius, including your teammates. A very large meme in the DRG community is that drillers love using a satchel charge purely to grief scout players. And while I'm not exactly going to object to that (it is pretty funny to be honest), just make sure you and you're teammates aren't also in the blast any other time, as the charges to monumental damage.</p>

                    <p class="body">Every team has that one member that's obsessed with technology, and the Engineer is engi-here to fill up that spot with a smile on his face. Sporting lighter primary weapons and more technology based heavy weapon secondaries, the engineer may be considered something of a support class to those who play other games with class based gameplay like Battlefield or Team Fortress 2. If anything, DRG's Engineer is incredibly similar to TF2's Engineer, as both can bring support fire in the form of automated sentry guns and relying on technological weaponry to fight.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Primaries</h3>

                    <img class="engineerPrimary" src="Weapon Outlines/Smart Rifle.webp">
                    <p class="body">The "Warthog" Auto 210 is a semi-auto shotgun with a drum magazine that excels in close range damage and stunning glyphids to keep them at bay. Though lacking in terms of ammo, the shotgun is very good at killing glyphids when you hit them in their weakpoints, so ammo shouldn't really be a problem if you can aim your shots right and have all of the pellets in your shotgun shells hit on target. However, the warthog almost relies TOO much on weakpoint hits, because the damage is lacking and the stun is not possible on normal body shots. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The "Stubby" Voltaic SMG is the second primary weapon the engineer can unlock and has a unique mechanic where there is a 25% chance for the enemy to be shocked by electricity, slowing them down and taking damage over time. The ingame reasoning for this is that an electrical generator was able to be wired into the firing mechanisms, allowing some of the bullets to be electrified. While excelling in rate of fire, the spread and rather meager damage is not entirely desirable, though closing the gap or upgrading the weapon can maximize your damage output.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The LOK-1 Smart Rifle is an SMG equipped with a small camera on the front of the iron sights, allowing the gun to automatically aim the bullets to any target it's locked onto. Holding down the fire button will allow the camera to start locking onto any targets in its range, firing at said targets when you let go of the button. A bar at the left side of the screen shows you how many locks you can and currently have, as long as there is enough ammo to still be fired in the magazine. While tap firing the gun is possible, locking on is much better for damaging enemies, as the time it takes to lock on is met with incredible fire rate.</p>

                    <p class="body">The Deepcore 40mm PGL is a single shot grenade launcher capable of dealing lots of damage in a large area. While the velocity of the grenades is not something to smile at, it can be upgraded to make them move much faster, meaning that you'll rarely have to actually aim the grenade launcher to damage the target. The grenades also have a fear factor to them, meaning that any enemies close to the explosion have a chance to run away in fear and be open to more fire from your teammates.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Breach Cutter is a heavy weapon secondary that fires wide lines of plasma that travel in a straight line when they are fired and deal constant damage to anything it passes through. These lines can deal damage to any enemy in the game, and can pass through all forms of terrain. Though only lasting for a short amount of time and having a rather small amount of ammo, the amount of damage that it does and its ability to cleave through armor plating is more than enough to compensate for these downsides.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Shard Diffractor is a laser cannon capable damaging and igniting any enemy at an incredible rate. Dealing damage to any enemy directly hit by and close to the beam, there is an infinite range to the shard diffractor, making it good for damaging anything at any distance. However, with incredible firepower come unique qualities to handling said weapon, mainly how the gun reloads and fires. Once you finish firing the gun, it will need to pull enough charge from the battery before it can start firing again. The gun will start recharging shortly after you finish firing, but it needs a full charge again before you can do damage. The best ways to use the gun is to focus on singular distant targets in burts, or use the entire charge on a swarm.</p>

These platforms are also made out of an incredibly soft material, significantly reducing fall damage and allowing you to fall from much higher heights without going down.

                    The signature aspect of playing as the engineer, the sentry guns can be built anywhere applicable to provide covering fire against any enemy in its range. The sentry can only hold a certain amount of ammo though, and will need to be reloaded manually by the engineer. However, the engineer can only hold a certain amount of ammo to reload the sentry with, though this ammo also gets refreshed at a resupply pod.</p>

                    The M1000 Classic is a modern take on a trueblood classic. In reality, the M1000 is just an M1 Garand, ping and all. However, the M1000 can fire a focused shot that does increased damage at the cost of an extra bullet. Holding the fire button will cause your screen to temporarily zoom in and allow you to hit your shot with much better accuracy.

                    The DRAK-25 Plasma Carbide is a plasma firing rifle that works similar to the Gunner's Lead Storm or the Driller's Plasma Charger. Pulling ammo from one singular ammo pool and overheating when fired too much, the plasma this weapon fires need to physically move towards their target, similar to the Sludge Pump's projectiles. However, these projectiles move incredibly slow and can miss their target very easily due to their slow velocity and wide bloom. Although the velocity can be massively improved upon, the damage for each projectile is rather low, meaning that killing anything larger than a grunt will require you to almost overheat the gun with the amount of ammo it requires. Despite its downsides, it is still an interesting weapon nonetheless.</p>

                    <p class="body">The Jury-Rigged Boomstick is a heavy hitting sawed off double barrel shotgun and is the scout's default secondary. Though it excels in blasting away enemies en masse, the gun produces a very large amount of recoil and has a very large amount of spread, meaning that the enemy needs to practically be eating the barrel to guarantee you hit all of your shots. However, with the right upgrades, the downsides are very heavily outmatched by the sheer stopping power and horde clearing potential that the boomstick can bring to the table.

                    The Zhukov NUK17 is a pair of machine pistols that excel in outputting as many rounds as possible, emptying both of the magazines in less than 2 seconds. However, with incredible bullet spewing comes with an incredible lack of damage, as killing anything larger than a grunt means that you WILL need to reload before killing it, as the damage output of the Zhukovs is incredibly small for the rate of fire they have. However, if you have an incredibly large target or a horde coming your way, there will be enough in front of you to guarantee that you'll hit what you're looking at.

                    The Nishanka Boltshark X-80 is the most unique secondary in the scouts arsenal. A single firing crossbow that can be upgraded to bring another special variety of arrow with it, the boltshark excels in pinpoint singlle target damage, Additionally, any missed bolts that don't hit a target can be retrieved and reused for later. Upgrading the weapon will increase the potency of your special bolts and the base stats of the bow, meaning that there are no technical downsides to the gun that can't be improved upon.</p>

                    <p class="body">The grappling hook is what makes playing the scout such a unique experience from everyone else, as well as what makes him so mobile. The grappling hook can be fired at any surface within its maximum distance, pulling you to that location in a straight, unwavering line as long as you don't let go of the fire button. With an incredibly short recharge timer no longer than 4 seconds, the scout can get anywhere within reach with the utmost of ease.

                    The scout's second support tool, the flare gun launches a bright white flare and imbeds it into whatever surface it lands on. The core of this flare will eventually run out after a certain amount of time, though this can be upgraded to be increased. These flares are better than the ones you throw normally, so if you're ever in a situation where you are having a hard time looking around the cave, your flare gun is your best friend. Launch them before or during a swarm, in a large area of the cave, wherever and whenever you need to, there's rarely a situation that's considered a bad usage of your flare gun.</p>

                    <h2 class="header">Teamwork Keeps You Alive</h2>
                    <p class="body">In a class based shooter with a game loop that's as unpredictable as Deep Rock Galactic's, you'll need to make sure your ability to cooperate with each other and communicate is at its best. The most optimal team is one of each class, as the most you can have on a team is 4, though that doesn't mean you can't have multiple of the same class. Each class has been balanced and maintained to make sure they're still a viable option no matter what situation or loadout, but there will be no team composition as optimal as having one of each class, as you can take each other's specialties and combine them with each other to make the most of every situation. Some weapon's upgrades coincide with effects that only other classes have access to, and some people's tools can be combined to have maximum efficiency. For example, scouts may grapple up to a high up mineral vein, but they can't mine any of it safely without an engineer's platforms. Being caught in a tight hallway during a swarm may seem like a death sentence normally, but bring an engineer's sentry guns or a driller, and you can keep yourself safe and on the move towards a safer area much faster than your pickaxes could take you. Learning how to use your abilities best will come with experience, so always think about what you can and can't do both with and without your teammates.</p>
