                <p class="body">Diversity makes things interesting, and Hoxxes certainly provides it. With 10 equally interesting biomes that are ready to house your destruction at any turn, each of them has their own flavor of volatility, but also their own kind of riches that lie below. Each biome has a different mineral that they have both an abundance and scarcity of, and a specific ecological hazard that's unique to that biome. However, to make the missions much more varied, certain biomes are available at certain times, with others being out of the scanner's range. Some bring plenty of pretty sights, some can turn you to dust with one wrong step, but each and every one of them is a different dish in the buffet of scenery that lies in the mines.</p>

                    <img class="biome-image" src="Biomes/Crystalline_caverns.png">
                    <p class="body">The crystalline caverns are filled with a large variety of crystals, albeit ones of no value to DRG. The terrain of this area is incredibly durable, taking three hits from a pickaxe before it breaks. Some of these crystals give off a natural light, allowing you to see better in the dark, while some of these crystals are very heavily charged with electricity and arc it between each other, dealing very heavy damage and slowing down anything caught between them when it goes off. Rain can occasionally fall as well, obscuring your vision and lowering the brightness of flares while it's going on.

                    <p class="body">The salt pits are very similar to the crystalline caverns, although the surrounding terrain is red and white as opposed to grey and blue, takes two hits to break, and is the only place you can find q'ronar younglings. However, the salt pits contain a danger much different than the electric crystals. When disturbed, unstable crystals will fall from the ceiling and damage anything they land on. These crystals are much worse, because you won't really see the crystals coming unless you see some falling first and realize you're in the splash zone.

                    <p class="body">Filled with a very large amount of flora, the fungus bogs is a very visually busy biome. Hallways between larger areas can be very hard to see in, even with flares, and I'll be very willing to bet that you'll be tired of the color green after a long/bad enough mission in this part of Hoxxes. The bogs also feature multiple hazards, some meant to annoy you, some meant to execute you. The two that are unique to the fungus bogs are small mushroom-like plants that puff out toxic fumes when you get close, and green goo that lays the ground, slowing down any and everything that steps in it. The third hazard that you'll find are red, bulbous plants that will explode when they take enough damage, though these can be found in multiple biomes, and tend to be in large clusters. These plants can be of varying sizes, blast radii, and time before explosion, but one thing is certain: Once they go off, anything nearby is most likely dead.

                    <p class="body">The most visually unappealing area in the entirety of Hoxxes IV, the radioactive exclusion zone (REZ) is filled with greyed out terrain and the air being filled with a plethora of an ash like substance. The result of being hammered by multiple millenia of gamma radiation, mutated fauna fill the caves, and crystals of solid uranium can be found around the caves, which are good at giving light but will damage you if you get too close. Enemies can be seen from a large distance away due to the radiation, and the glyphid praetorians now have radioactive attacks as opposed to their normal acid.

                    <p class="body">Another biome on the denser side of flora and vegetation, the dense biozone is filled with the highest amount of environmental variation in the game. Featuring blue terrain and a variety of helpful plants and interesting vegetation, the dense biozone is also one of the the only places you can find naedocyte shockers. However, not everything in the area is friendly, as the unique hazard of this biome is the ejector cacti, a large green plant coated in spikes that can launch them out in every direction towards anything that comes even remotely close to it.

                    <p class="body">Coated in a planetwide layer of permafrost, the glacial strata is one of the more dangerous biomes in the game. Filled with multiple hazards like cryo bombs and vents, blizzards, terrain that breaks when you step on it, and unstable icicles that can fall from the ceiling, this biome has unequivocally the highest amount of unique hazards in the game, though the blizzard is the only unavoidable one. However, since this is the <i>ice</i> biome, you can find multiple vents around the cave to stand near to negate the buildup on the freeze debuff. If this bar fills, you'll freeze in place and will need to break yourself out, so stand by these vents whenever you need to. On top of this, naedocyte shockers and ice variants of some enemies can be found in this biome, further making sure the land finds a way to freeze you to death.

                    <p class="body">Resembling the interior of a dead tree, the hollow bough is an incredibly volatile biome. Due to an invasive species of vine, not much else has been able to prosper outside of a unique form of wasp. The vines can also be covered in a series of spikes, meaning that these vines are not always dangerous, but you should avoid caution nonetheless. Though sometimes, the vines seek violence, and the stabber vines are here to fill up that slot. Stabber vines come in pairs of 3, and will try to attack you whenever possible. Keep throwing flares and try not to lose your sense of direction, because darkness and deadly terrain is your best friend while you're here.

                    <p class="body">Without a doubt the most visually beautiful biome in the game, the azure weald is filled with a variety of flora that produce soft lights. Though despite its beautiful aesthetic, the azure weald is still incredibly deadly. This biome's unique "hazard" is a set of pillars known simply as "p[[[[[[[{0}]]]]]]]q," a set of blue magical pillars that gives a defence buff to anything that steps inside of it, imcluding glyphids, so it can make some situations incredibly dangerous if it shows up in the wrong spot.

                    <p class="body">Arguably THE most volatile biome in all of Hoxxes, the Magma Core is filled to the brim with dangerous things. Already having the highest temperature of any biome, the magma core has anything related to fire that you could think of. Lava geysers, hot rock being created at any explosion, and constant quakes that slow you down and cause breaks in the terrain. On top of that, explosive plants love to show up, and while it is better to blow them up for the sake of safety later, these explosive plants cause hot rock to appear where they were, dealing slight damage and buildup to the burning debuff.

                    <p class="body">The only biome with terrain that breaks in one hit, the sandblasted corridors is one of the emptiest biomes on Hoxxes. Filled with fossils and next to no vegetation whatsoever, the caves you'll find here will be filled with a whole lot of nothing aside from the usual enemies. However, these corridors are home to the nayaka trawler sandshark, as well as the deeptora honeycomb and its bees. Other than those two, the only other unique hazard you'll find is an occasional sandstorm that will very heavily dampen your vision and slightly slow your movement.
